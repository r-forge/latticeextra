Changes in Version 0.5-3

 o improvements to marginal.plot including support for groups.

 o fix to marginal.plot: failed with only numeric variables.

 o fix to panel.voronoi (with use.tripack = FALSE):
   wrong colors were used when xlim/ylim enclosed a data subset.

 o new function 'as.layer' and a method 'as.layer.trellis'.
   This allows panels to be overlaid with independent x/y scales.

Previous Changes

 o several new data sets and a few utility functions

 o dendrogramGrob to produce a dendrogram that can be used as a legend

 o new generic function 'gplot' -- like 'plot', but meant to produce a
   `grouped' Trellis plot.  Methods can be defined for objects that
    already have a 'plot' method.  API Currently unstable.
